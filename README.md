A collection of data science and analytics projects that I have been working on in recent months.
I'm sharing the code for projects that are not proprietary or are currently used as assignments in courses I took.
If you are a prospective employer and want to see more of my work, send me an email to give you access to a private repository.
Thanks,
Diana.
